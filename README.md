# Social Media Tourism

A social media networking platform analyses an aviation company's ticket sales history and user's social media presence to predict whether the user is going to adopt the tourism package.

**Skills and Tools:** Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CART, KNN

**Conclusion:**

The project involved developing five different ML models to predict whether a visiting customer would opt for a suggested tour package. The suggested offering would be based on customer's requirements and by studying patterns and trends from previous tour packages. Based on data collected after mining, we will suggest a personalised travel package recommendation.
